    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Call me crazy, but most of the time when I can use a web app over a
native app, I prefer the web app. Maybe some of you do, too.</p>

<p>Anyways, one of my favorite web apps is <a href="http://rdio.com">Rdio</a>. I
recently found myself wishing I could control the web app with my <a href="http://www.apple.com/keyboard/">Apple
Wireless Keyboard&#8217;s</a> media controls.
Well, with a little hacking on a great
<a href="https://github.com/borismus/keysocket/">project</a> put together by <a href="http://smus.com/">Boris
Smus</a>, it&#8217;s now possible (Mac Only for now).</p>

<h3>How to add keyboard shortcuts to Rdio&#8217;s web app</h3>

<h4>Pre-requisites</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>First, you&#8217;ll want to clone <a href="https://github.com/borismus/keysocket/">his repo</a>.
To do so, simply run the following command from the terminal:</p>

<p>  <code>
  git clone https://github.com/borismus/keysocket.git
 </code></p></li>
<li><p>Once you&#8217;ve cloned it, download and install the <a href="https://github.com/downloads/borismus/keysocket/KeySocket.zip">Key Socket.app</a>.
This app will be installed on your Mac, and essentially messages the
extension that a button has been pressed (I will explain this more later
in the post).</p></li>
<li><p>If you haven&#8217;t already, make sure you start the Key Socket.app. I
would also recommend adjusting your system to start it up when the
system boots.</p></li>
</ol>


<h4>Alright, let&#8217;s get started</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>Now it&#8217;s time to hack. Open up a terminal and <code>cd</code> into <code>/extension</code>
within the project directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, create a file for the rdio adapter. To do so, run:</p>

<p> <code>
 touch keysocket-rdio.js
</code></p></li>
<li><p>Now, open up the <code>keysocket-rdio.js</code> file you just created, and put the following code
in there (I will explain it later on in the post):</p></li>
</ol>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/1548707.js"> </script>


<p>Finally, open up the <code>manifest.json</code> file, and adjust it to be like
so (I will also explain this later on in the post):</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1548717.js"> </script>


<h4>Adding the extension to Chrome</h4>

<p>Believe it or not, the extension is done! Now, we&#8217;ve just got to add it
to Chrome. To do so, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Navigate your browser to: <code>chrome://extensions</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the button that says <strong>&#8220;Load unpacked extension&#8230;&#8221;</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to the <code>/extension</code> directory, and click <strong>&#8220;Select&#8221;</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have Rdio&#8217;s web app open, give it a refresh, and your media keys should
now be controlling the application! Make sure you don&#8217;t have iTunes
and Rdio open (or the <a href="http://www.rdio.com/#/apps/mac/">Rdio Mac App</a> and the web app open), as it will affect both applications.</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Further explanation</h3>

<p>Awesome - you should now be able to control Rdio&#8217;s web app from your keyboard!
I mentioned above that I&#8217;ll be explaining a few things later on in the
post, so if you&#8217;d like to know more about how those things work, just
keep on reading.</p>

<h4>How the heck does this work?</h4>

<p>It&#8217;s actually not that complicated at all. Boris does a great job of
explaining it on his <a href="http://smus.com/chrome-media-keys-revisited">blog post</a> about creating the keysocket app and
extension. I&#8217;d recommend checking that out (and following him on <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/borismus">Twitter</a>
- he&#8217;s extremely bright and has lots of great stuff).</p>

<p>Essentially, the keysocket app installed locally messages the extension
when you press a button down. If that button&#8217;s character code matches
what we define in our <code>keysocket-rdio.js</code> file (in this case, 20 for the
previous button, 16 for play/pause, and 19 for the next button), then it
executes the <code>simulateClick</code> function, passing in the element ID that we
defined.</p>

<p>It then, well, simulates a click on that element.</p>

<h4>Explaning keysocket-rdio.js</h4>

<p>If you look at this file and compare it to the other
<code>keysocket-x.js</code> files, you&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;s very similar. To be frank, I
just copied &amp; pasted what Boris had done with other services, and modified it to work with
Rdio. However - it&#8217;s good to know how I ended up changing it.</p>

<p>It was extremely simple - the block of code from <code>line 34 - line 42</code> is
all that needed modification. I just changed the ID&#8217;s of Rdio&#8217;s elements
in the DOM to match what action was supposed to happen.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="http://f.cl.ly/items/3Q1k440z0I403M2Y1B1k/Screen%20Shot%202012-01-01%20at%206.21.14%20PM.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3P0m350A2n1A213n0q08/rdio-small.png"></a>
  <figcaption><strong>Above:</strong> The DOM tree that makes up Rdio&#8217;s player</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>For example, on line 34. If the key pressed&#8217;s keyCode is equal to the
<code>PREV</code>&#8217;s value (which happens if you press F7 on the Apple keyboard), it
runs the <code>simulateClick</code> function and passes in the <code>previousButton</code> ID.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s really it, just copied 3 times. If you have any questions about
it, feel free to let me know on twitter.</p>

<h4>Explaning manifest.json</h4>

<p>Every chrome extension <strong>requires</strong> a <code>manifest.json</code> file. (<strong>note:</strong>
if you&#8217;d like to learn more about Chrome Extension development, check
out my <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/how-i-made-the-domai-nr-chrome-extension/">article on nettuts</a>.)</p>

<p>All we are doing here is saying if the current URL <em>matches</em>
<code>http://www.rdio.com/*</code>, load the <code>keysocket-rdio.js</code> file. That ending
<code>*</code> is required, becuase it&#8217;s a wildcard character. Basically, that
means the <code>keysocket-rdio.js</code> file will load at any path within
<code>http://rdio.com</code>, not just the root path.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: After my &#8220;semester&#8221; working in San Francisco, <strong>humility</strong>
has separated the great from the good.</p>

<hr />

<p>If this &#8220;semester&#8221; off taught me one thing, it&#8217;s best summed up in a
poster I saw the other day on <a href="http://pinterest.com">pinterest</a>:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2D1G3s2S412j1q2Z2e2P/tumblr_lq55rpvIw81qzcrkbo1_500.jpeg">
  <figcaption><strong>Above:</strong> That says it all, folks.
</figure>


<p>That&#8217;s not a perfect representation (being kind isn&#8217;t the same as
humility - I know), but you get the point.</p>

<p>While I&#8217;m sure there are a number of successful assholes in the valley
(I mean <em>real</em> assholes, not those who just <em>seem</em> like assholes), those
who appear the <strong>most successful</strong> (financially and by the quality of
their life) are the most humble people I&#8217;ve ever met.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#8217;m biased. I did get to work with people like
<a href="http://twitter.com/ev">Ev</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/biz">Biz</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/goldman">Goldman</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/stirman">Stirman</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/jcrosby">Jon</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/tonystubblebine">Tony</a>,
Jeremy, <a href="http://twitter.com/dustin">Senos</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/ded">Diaz</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/jyhsu">Jean</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/danfuzz">Dan</a> and
<a href="http://twitter.com/don_neufeld">Don</a>. So, my point of view <em>is</em> a bit biased,
as these people are all the <strong>very</strong> best in our field.</p>

<p>But still - it&#8217;s mind blowing to see people like these even outside of
<a href="http://obvious.com">Obvious</a> be so humble and eager to learn from their mistakes and the
successes of others.</p>

<h3>After my experiences, I truly think humility is a key factor in success</h3>

<p>If you closely examine the <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles">Lean Methodology</a>, humility is at the
core. To fully execute a lean practice, one <strong>has</strong> to be humble and
willing to learn from failures and the successes of others. The
<a href="http://lift.do">Lift</a> team would sometimes just stop what we were
doing, based on user feedback, and throw our progress on that feature
away. It sucked, and was really hard to do the first few times. But it
ended up working out well for us, as it pushed us closer to the product
they are developing today.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s exactly how the most successful companies get to where they
are. Crazy how things scale like that, huh?</p>

<h3>Lessons learned from IDEO and LUXr</h3>

<p>One of the (many) perks of being part of <a href="http://obvious.com">Obvious</a>
was our tour of IDEO in Mountain View. I could (and most likely will)
have several posts dedicated to the day we spent there. Long story short
- <a href="http://www.ideo.com/people/david-kelley">David Kelley</a>, the Chairman
and founder of IDEO, gave us the tour. It was an amazing experience.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, the way their process works is similar to <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/">Eric Reis</a>&#8217;
<strong>Build -> Measure -> Learn</strong>, with an emphasis on the <em>build</em>. By that,
I mean they iterate like there&#8217;s no tomorrow. Their whole culture is
based on initially generating an insane amount of variations, and to try and think
outside of the box as much as possible. This mindset is critical when it
comes to their incredible success designing products.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="http://theleanstartup.com/images/methodology_diagram.jpg">
  <figcaption><strong>Above:</strong> Lean uses the &#8220;Build -> Measure -> Learn&#8221; practice</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>But it&#8217;s not <strong>just</strong> relentless iteration. They tie in user feedback
and testing heavily into their process. <strong>This is where humility ties
in</strong> - the user feedback and testing. You must put your ego to the curb,
because in the end - it&#8217;s only going to hurt.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/141Q1g0i3R0e1l0c0225/IMG_0046.jpg" style="height: 400px;">
  <figcaption><strong>Above:</strong> The test samples IDEO used when creating the first Microsoft Mouse.
</figure>


<p>Since Lift was part of the <a href="http://luxr.co">LUXr</a> Fall Cohort these past few
months (which I <em>highly</em> recommend), we got to use these methods in
practice. Except, they called them a <strong>flair &amp; focus</strong>. Essentially - we
build/conceptualize several ideas very quickly, test them for a period
of time on a number of audiences, and then finish implementing which one
yielded greater results.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re familiar with Lean, this should be ringing a bell right now.</p>

<p>The key here is that this all felt like a sprint. We&#8217;d work very fast in
short bursts, and frankly, most of the time, would end up stashing a lot
of code away. On the surface, this sounds like a waste. In hindsight, it
was critical in the shaping of Lift, and I&#8217;m so excited to see where
they go with their knowledge gained from these practices.</p>

<h3>Bringing it all together</h3>

<p>Regardless of whether your company is looking to improve, or you as an
individual wants to grow and thrive, I&#8217;ve found <strong>being humble helped me
learn more than I could have ever imagined in this &#8220;semester&#8221; of working</strong>.
Fortunately, this goes very well with the mindset often found in our
field that we must always be learning something new. But instead of
picking something new up, we&#8217;re just sharpening what we&#8217;ve already got.</p>
