  <h3 class="tk-museo-slab meta">Posted on 01 Jan 2012</h3>

  <p class="update">
<strong>Update 2:</strong> with the recent <a href="http://blog.rdio.com/us/2012/06/introducing-a-brighter-lighter-rdio.html">reskinning</a> (which is beautiful, by the way), Rdio has removed the back button. At first you&#8217;d wonder why, but apparently very <a href="https://twitter.com/RdioHelp/status/220263759271301122">few people used it</a>. I have updated the code below to still make it work.
</p>




<p class="update">
<del><strong>Update:</strong> with the launch of <a href="http://blog.rdio.com/us/2012/03/introducing-new-rdio.html">Rdio 2.0</a>, some of the markup has changed. I have updated the <a href="https://gist.github.com/2067842">link to the gist</a> in the post.</del>
</p>


<p>If you&#8217;d like to just download the source for this, and not work through
it, <a href="http://cl.ly/3e022N1d1T0N0n2p1w2k">here you go</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Call me crazy, but most of the time when I can use a web app over a
native app, I prefer the web app. Maybe some of you do, too.</p>

<p>Anyways, one of my favorite web apps is <a href="http://rdio.com">Rdio</a>. I
recently found myself wishing I could control the web app with my <a href="http://www.apple.com/keyboard/">Apple
Wireless Keyboard&#8217;s</a> media controls. Not
only do I wish I could control the web app, but I want to be able to
control it when any window is focused and any tab is my foremost tab.
Well, with a little hacking on a great
<a href="https://github.com/borismus/keysocket/">project</a> put together by <a href="http://smus.com/">Boris
Smus</a>, it&#8217;s now possible (Mac Only for now).</p>

<h3>How to add keyboard shortcuts to Rdio&#8217;s web app</h3>

<h4>Pre-requisites</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>First, you&#8217;ll want to clone <a href="https://github.com/borismus/keysocket/">his repo</a>.
To do so, simply run the following command from the terminal:</p>

<p>  <code>
  git clone https://github.com/borismus/keysocket.git
 </code></p></li>
<li><p>Once you&#8217;ve cloned it, download and install the <a href="https://github.com/downloads/borismus/keysocket/KeySocket.zip">Key Socket.app</a>.
This app will be installed on your Mac, and essentially messages the
extension that a button has been pressed (I will explain this more later
in the post).</p></li>
<li><p>If you haven&#8217;t already, make sure you start the Key Socket.app. I
would also recommend adjusting your system to start it up when the
system boots.</p></li>
</ol>


<h4>Alright, let&#8217;s get started</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>Now it&#8217;s time to hack. Open up a terminal and <code>cd</code> into <code>/extension</code>
within the project directory.</p></li>
<li><p><del>Next, create a file for the rdio adapter. To do so, run</del> We
need to create two files: one for the Rdio adapter (keysocket-rdio.js), and one javascript file that our Rdio adapter injects for us (rdio-prev.js):</p>

<p> <code>
 touch keysocket-rdio.js rdio-prev.js
</code></p></li>
</ol>


<p>We need two files here because Chrome extensions have a sandboxed
environment. We can&#8217;t access global variables on the page (which, in our
case, we&#8217;re using. More on that below).</p>

<ol>
<li>Now, open up the <code>keysocket-rdio.js</code> file you just created, and put the following code
in there (I will explain it later on in the post):</li>
</ol>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/2067842.js"> </script>


<ol>
<li>Open up <code>rdio-prev.js</code>, and put the following code in it:</li>
</ol>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/3049039.js"> </script>


<p>Finally, open up the <code>manifest.json</code> file, and adjust it to be like
so (I will also explain this later on in the post):</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1548717.js"> </script>


<h4>Adding the extension to Chrome</h4>

<p>Believe it or not, the extension is done! Now, we&#8217;ve just got to add it
to Chrome. To do so, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Navigate your browser to: <code>chrome://extensions</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the button that says <strong>&#8220;Load unpacked extension&#8230;&#8221;</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to the <code>/extension</code> directory, and click <strong>&#8220;Select&#8221;</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have Rdio&#8217;s web app open, give it a refresh, and your media keys should
now be controlling the application! Make sure you don&#8217;t have iTunes
and Rdio open (or the <a href="http://www.rdio.com/#/apps/mac/">Rdio Mac App</a> and the web app open), as it will affect both applications.</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Further explanation</h3>

<p>Awesome - you should now be able to control Rdio&#8217;s web app from your keyboard!
I mentioned above that I&#8217;ll be explaining a few things later on in the
post, so if you&#8217;d like to know more about how those things work, just
keep on reading.</p>

<h4>How the heck does this work?</h4>

<p><del>It&#8217;s actually not that complicated at all.</del> It wasn&#8217;t that complicated, until Rdio came out with newnew Rdio - then there was a bit of a curveball. Before getting into that, it&#8217;s worth nothing that Boris does a great job of
explaining it on his <a href="http://smus.com/chrome-media-keys-revisited">blog post</a> about creating the keysocket app and
extension. I&#8217;d recommend checking that out (and following him on <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/borismus">Twitter</a>
- he&#8217;s extremely bright and has lots of great stuff).</p>

<p>Essentially, the keysocket app installed locally messages the extension
when you press a button down. If that button&#8217;s character code matches
what we define in our <code>keysocket-rdio.js</code> file (in this case, 20 for the
previous button, 16 for play/pause, and 19 for the next button), then it
executes the <code>simulateClick</code> function, passing in the <del>element ID</del> class that we defined.</p>

<p><strong>The catch</strong> is that now, there&#8217;s no <code>previous</code> button. So, we had to
adjust our logic here. Now, what we&#8217;re doing is creating a fake button
element (with an id of <code>fake_prev_el</code>). We make it invisible (height of
0px and width of 0px) and append it to the DOM.</p>

<p>In most cases, we could just add and event listener in the
keysocket-rdio script, but we can&#8217;t do that here. We have to actually
append another script file, the <code>rdio-prev.js</code> file to the document.
That&#8217;s because Chrome sandboxes extensions. By injecting this script
element, we can then manipulate the page like we&#8217;d be able to with plain
old javascript.</p>

<p>It then, well, simulates a click on the correct element.</p>

<p>In the case of executing a click on the <code>fake_prev_el</code> element, it will
call the <code>previous</code> method on the Rdio&#8217;s <code>player</code> object they have in
their backbone code.</p>

<p>One may ask: why didn&#8217;t I just simulate a <code>keyPress</code> and pass in
<code>‚Üê</code> or <code>[</code>, seeing those keyboard shortcuts still work when you&#8217;ve got
the Rdio tab focused in chrome. Turns out there&#8217;s an issue in any
webkit-based browser when trying to create a keyboard event, and you
cannot modify the keyCode of a simulated keyPress - it is just set at 0
without the ability to change it.</p>

<h4>Explaning keysocket-rdio.js</h4>

<p><del>If you look at this file and compare it to the other
<code>keysocket-x.js</code> files, you&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;s very similar. To be frank, I
just copied &amp; pasted what Boris had done with other services, and modified it to work with
Rdio. However - it&#8217;s good to know how I ended up changing it.</p>

<p>It was extremely simple - the block of code from <code>line 34 - line 42</code> is
all that needed modification. I just changed the <del>ID&#8217;s</del> classes of Rdio&#8217;s elements
in the DOM to match what action was supposed to happen.</del></p>

<p>For the most part, this is very similar to the other <code>keysocket-x.js</code>
files. I ended up injecting the <code>rdio-prev.js</code> file so we can access the
global variable Rdio exposes, which powers the application.</p>

  <figcaption><strong>Above:</strong> The DOM tree that makes up newnew Rdio&#8217;s player</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>For example, on line 34. If the key pressed&#8217;s keyCode is equal to the
<code>NEXT</code>&#8217;s value (which happens if you press F9 on the Apple keyboard), it
runs the <code>simulateClick</code> function and passes in the <code>next</code> class.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s really it, just copied 3 times. If you have any questions about
it, feel free to let me know on twitter.</p>

<h4>Explaning manifest.json</h4>

<p>Every chrome extension <strong>requires</strong> a <code>manifest.json</code> file. (<strong>note:</strong>
if you&#8217;d like to learn more about Chrome Extension development, check
out my <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/how-i-made-the-domai-nr-chrome-extension/">article on nettuts</a>.)</p>

<p>All we are doing here is saying if the current URL <em>matches</em>
<code>http://www.rdio.com/*</code>, load the <code>keysocket-rdio.js</code> file. That ending
<code>*</code> is required, becuase it&#8217;s a wildcard character. Basically, that
means the <code>keysocket-rdio.js</code> file will load at any path within
<code>http://rdio.com</code>, not just the root path.</p>
