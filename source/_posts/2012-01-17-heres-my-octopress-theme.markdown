I'm sure it's no surprise that **I <3 Octopress**. I recently redesigned
my [personal site](http://cnnr.me/), and decided to blog more in 2012
(and hopefully for many years to come).

With that, I wanted to customize the look of my blog to match my new,
minimalistic site. So, [here you go](INSERT LINK HERE). I thought I'd
open-source my Octopress theme, since it's pretty much the
polar-opposite of what comes with it by default.

### How to install

While this is a somewhat hacky way to get the theme installed, Brandon
is [working on a theme gallery](https://twitter.com/#!/imathis/status/156153275761176576),
which sounds great. Until then, though, this will suffice.

#### First, clone the repo.

git clone git@github.com:connormontgomery/CONNOR_CHANGE_THIS.git
