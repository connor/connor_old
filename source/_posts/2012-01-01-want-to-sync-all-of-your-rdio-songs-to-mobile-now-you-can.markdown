I've always wanted to just be able to shuffle through my entire
collection on Rdio's mobile app. While it's on their timeline, it's not
currently implemented.

This is a (super) hacky way to accomplish what I wanted. Essentially, it
creates two playlists:

1. All songs in your collection
2. All songs sync'd to mobile

From there, you can shuffle through them :D
