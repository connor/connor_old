**tl;dr**: After my "semester" working in San Francisco, **humility**
has separated the great from the good.

- - -

If this "semester" off taught me one thing, it's best summed up in a
poster I saw the other day on [pinterest](http://pinterest.com):

That's not a perfect representation (being kind isn't the same as
humility - I know), but you get the point.

While I'm sure there are a number of successful assholes in the valley
(I mean *real* assholes, not those who just *seem* like assholes), those
who appear the **most successful** (financially and by the quality of
their life) are the most humble people I've ever met.

Maybe I'm biased. I did get to work with people like
[Ev](http://twitter.com/ev), [Biz](http://twitter.com/biz),
[Goldman](http://twitter.com/goldman),
[Stirman](http://twitter.com/stirman),
[Jon](http://twitter.com/jcrosby), [Tony](http://twitter.com/tonystubblebine),
Jeremy, [Senos](http://twitter.com/dustin), [Diaz](http://twitter.com/ded),
[Jean](http://twitter.com/jyhsu), [Dan](http://twitter.com/danfuzz) and
[Don](http://twitter.com/don_neufeld). So, my point of view *is* a bit biased,
as these people are all the **very** best in our field.

But still - it's mind blowing to see people like these even outside of
[Obvious](http://obvious.com) be so humble and eager to learn from their mistakes and the
successes of others.

### After my experiences, I truly think humility is a key factor in success

If you closely examine the [Lean Methodology](http://theleanstartup.com/principles), humility is at the
core. To fully execute a lean practice, one **has** to be humble and
willing to learn from failures and the successes of others. The
[Lift](http://lift.do) team would sometimes just stop what we were
doing, based on user feedback, and throw our progress on that feature
away. It sucked, and was really hard to do the first few times. But it
ended up working out well for us, as it pushed us closer to the product
they are developing today.

But that's exactly how the most successful companies get to where they
are. Crazy how things scale like that, huh?

### Lessons learned from IDEO and LUXr

One of the (many) perks of being part of [Obvious](http://obvious.com)
was our tour of IDEO in Mountain View. I could (and most likely will)
have several posts dedicated to the day we spent there. Long story short
- [David Kelley](http://www.ideo.com/people/david-kelley), the Chairman
and founder of IDEO, gave us the tour. It was an amazing experience.

In a nutshell, the way their process works is similar to [Eric Reis](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/)'
**Build -> Measure -> Learn**, with an emphasis on the *build*. By that,
I mean they iterate like there's no tomorrow. Their whole culture is
based on initially generating an insane amount of variations, and to try and think
outside of the box as much as possible. This mindset is critical when it
comes to their incredible success designing products.

But it's not **just** relentless iteration. They tie in user feedback
and testing heavily into their process. **This is where humility ties
in** - the user feedback and testing. You must put your ego to the curb,
because in the end - it's only going to hurt.

Since Lift was part of the [LUXr](http://luxr.co) Fall Cohort these past few
months (which I *highly* recommend), we got to use these methods in
practice. Except, they called them a **flair & focus**. Essentially - we
build/conceptualize several ideas very quickly, test them for a period
of time on a number of audiences, and then finish implementing which one
yielded greater results.

If you're familiar with Lean, this should be ringing a bell right now.

The key here is that this all felt like a sprint. We'd work very fast in
short bursts, and frankly, most of the time, would end up stashing a lot
of code away. On the surface, this sounds like a waste. In hindsight, it
was critical in the shaping of Lift, and I'm so excited to see where
they go with their knowledge gained from these practices.

### Bringing it all together

Regardless of whether your company is looking to improve, or you as an
individual wants to grow and thrive, I've found **being humble helped me
learn more than I could have ever imagined in this "semester" of working**.
Fortunately, this goes very well with the mindset often found in our
field that we must always be learning something new. But instead of
picking something new up, we're just sharpening what we've already got.
