I'm pleased to announce the launch of [HTML5
Please](http://html5please.us)! I was trying to think of a description
for HTML5Please, but think [Divya](http://nimbupani.com/)
says it best in her [blog post](http://nimbupani.com/html5please.html) about it:

> "We hope this to be a global set of recommendations that web developers could consult and tap on when they are deciding on how to use features"

[Lots of awesome people](https://github.com/h5bp/html5please/contributors) helped make this, and let's make an effort to keep it as up-to-date as possible!

So, with that being said, can I [plz use some
HTML5's](http://html5please.us)?
