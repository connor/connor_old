I've always wanted to just be able to shuffle through my entire
collection on Rdio's mobile app. While it's on their <a href="http://help.rdio.com/customer/portal/questions/50582-when-will-i-be-able-to-play-my-collection-" target="_blank">timeline</a>, it's not
currently implemented.

This is a (super) hacky way to accomplish what I wanted. Essentially, it
creates two playlists:

1. All songs in your collection
2. All songs sync'd to mobile

From there, you can shuffle through them, just like you've always wanted
to.
